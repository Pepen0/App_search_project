## Introduction

Hello, I'm an engineering student and this is a project I've been working on to automate the search for apartments using Selenium and Python. The idea is to extract criteria from an Excel file, search for apartments on a property listing site, and then analyze the results using various APIs.

## Functionalities

### Criteria Extraction:

> The system reads search criteria (like location, price range, and property type) from an Excel file.
> 

### Website Interaction:

> Using Selenium, the system interacts with a property listing website, filling in the search criteria.
> 

### Search Execution:

> The system initiates the search based on the entered criteria.
> 



## Getting Started

1. Lookup the [GitHub](https://github.com/Pepen0/App_search_project/tree/main)
2. To run the project, make sure you have the required packages installed.
3. You can use the requirements.txt file (coming soon!) to install them.
4. Once set up, execute the main script to start the search process.
