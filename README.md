## Introduction

Hello, I'm an engineering student and this is a project I've been working on to automate the search for apartments using Selenium and Python. The idea is to extract criteria from an Excel file, search for apartments on a property listing site, and then analyze the results using various APIs.

## Current Functionality

### Criteria Extraction:

> The system reads search criteria (like location, price range, and property type) from an Excel file.
> 

### Website Interaction:

> Using Selenium, the system interacts with a property listing website, filling in the search criteria.
> 

### Search Execution:

> The system initiates the search based on the entered criteria.
> 

## Potential Missing Parts & Future Work

### Search Completion:

> Implement functionality to trigger and complete the search after entering all criteria.
> 

### Pagination Handling:

> Navigate through multiple pages of search results, if available.
> 

### Data Extraction:

> Extract property details such as price, location, amenities, and more from the search results.
> 

### Google Maps Integration:

> Integrate with the Google Maps API to fetch location-related details for each property.
> 

### ChatGPT Integration:

> Analyze property descriptions using ChatGPT or similar APIs to extract more insights.
> 

### Data Storage:

> Save the extracted property details to a database or another Excel file.
> 

### Error Handling:

> Implement mechanisms to handle scenarios like no results found, CAPTCHA challenges, or unexpected website layout changes.
> 

### Notifications:

> Implement a system to notify users about the results or any issues encountered during the search.

## Getting Started

1. Lookup the [GitHub](https://github.com/Pepen0/App_search_project/tree/main)
2. To run the project, make sure you have the required packages installed.
3. You can use the requirements.txt file (coming soon!) to install them.
4. Once set up, execute the main script to start the search process.
